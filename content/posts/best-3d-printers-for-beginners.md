## Best 3D Printers for Beginners 2022

The ideal 3D printer for beginners should be affordable, accessible, and easy to use. As a beginner with limited technical know-how, you might appreciate a fairly intuitive model. If you're more experienced, a model that offers a more intricate detail level may better suit your needs.

Regardless of your budget or experience with 3D printers, we've scoured the market and come up with a list of the best 3D printers for beginners in 2022 based on extensive research, expert testing, and in-depth reviews.

## OUR TOP 3D PRINTER FOR BEGINNERS

We picked the [**Original Prusa Mini+**](#) as our top pick because it delivers nearly all of our best-rated 3D printers (the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+) in a smaller form factor for less money. The Mini+ is a finely tuned 3D printer with a large community and excellent customer service behind it, despite having a smaller build volume than most other printers.

The [**Prusa**](#) printer is well-known in the 3D printing community and comes with an incredible amount of information about just about any issue you could encounter. And, if a company doesn't have it, the community most certainly will.

The following is a list of 3D printers for beginners that will introduce beginners to the world of 3D printing.

## BEST 3D PRINTERS FOR BEGINNERS

There are many types of 3D printers available in the market today. When it comes to 3D printing, there is no single type of printer that will fit everyone's needs. It all boils down to individual use cases, what one wants to print and how often you plan on using your printer in the future.

This list has a wide range of printers for various budgets and experience levels.

Here's a rundown of the finest 3D printers for novices, from lowest to highest, based on price rather than preference.

## **Anycubic Mega Zero 2.0**

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/71fVXCAukLL._SX425_.jpg)

The first on our list of the best 3D printers for beginners is the [**Anycubic Mega Zero 2.0**](#). We felt it provides all the features and functionality of a primary consumer 3D printer at a competitive price.

This budget friendly printer has a good build volume and comes with a heated bed and removable build plate, making it easy to use and relatively maintenance-free. The [**Mega Zero 2.0**](#) has a built-in RAMPS board, which can automatically detect whether a print is going in the right direction or not and will compensate accordingly.

The user manual also shows step-by-step instructions on operating the printer with ease. The AnYcubic Mega Zero 2.0 comes fully assembled and calibrated, making it ready to use right out of the box.

This 3D printer for beginners is straightforward enough for anyone with experience using a computer to figure it out but maybe too basic for those seeking more advanced features. The price point is unbeatable, considering the attractive features of this printer.

## **Creality Ender 3 V2**

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61Jg1UeOkKL._SL1000_.jpg)

Another inexpensive 3D printer for beginners on our list is the [**Creality Ender 3 V2**](#). The Ender 3 V2 builds upon the success of its predecessor. It continues to be a favorite budget-friendly printer among hobbyists and those who wish to enter this field, like students or teachers.

The [**Creality Ender 3 V2**](#) has a very high build volume for its price and comes with a heated print bed, allowing the user to print out bigger objects at a lower price point. This printer is ideal for creating large prints since it has a 220 x 220 x 250 mm big build volume.

The [**Creality Ender 3 V2**](#) also uses a Bowden extruder, a feature that has been present with many 3D printers in previous years. This 3D printer is quite simple to set up and operate, mostly built at the factory.

This printer provides one of the most hassle-free printing experiences out there because one can use it right away after you open the box. This printer comes at an affordable price tag and is equipped with an MK10 style hot end that uses a spring lock to hold the filament in place without relying too much on pressure from the extruder gear.

## **Original Prusa Mini+**

![](https://cdn.prusa3d.com/content/images/product/default/2280.jpg)

The [**Original Prusa Mini+**](#) is the most popular 3D printer for novices, which is a great place to start if you are looking for an entry-level 3D printer that you can try your hands on.

This Czech-based 3D printer for beginners is a kit that needs to be assembled but is definitely worth the effort. It is closely related to the Original Prusa i3 MK3S+ and is built using the same components.

The [**Original Prusa Mini+**](#) is supplied with a detachable PEI-coated metal bed, an auto bed-leveling probe, and outstanding customer service.

It has a relatively small build volume of 180 x 180 x 180 mm, sufficient for most beginner prints.

This printer's instruction manuals are easy to follow and will help you assemble them quickly. And since the printer is closely related to the [**Original Prusa i3 MK3S+**](#), all of its parts are interchangeable with its bigger brother, a larger printer, since they share the same specs. This means that you can always upgrade to a larger kit.

## **Creality CR-6 SE**

![Creality3D CR-6 SE 3D Printer](https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0508/1494/3382/products/0b4118c4ec.jpg.500x500_1024x1024.jpg?v=1603705747)

The [**Creality CR-6**](#) is a 3D printer for beginners that is easy to set up and provides high performance.

The Maker Select Plus results from the firm's first Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign (which raised around $4.5 million). It includes a proprietary auto bed leveling technology (that works quite effectively), live Z-offsetting while printing, custom aluminum extrusions, twin Z-axis motors, responsive touch screen interface, and custom extruder assembly.

The stock print quality is also excellent, which gets the Ender 5 Pro to this list.

When combined with the breadth of features and comparable-ish build quality and price, you have extra cash and consider the [**Ender 3 V2**](#); the [**CR-6 SE**](#) is, in essence, the deluxe version of that printer with a lot more features and less intimidating processes for novices.

## **Monoprice Voxel**

![Monoprice Voxel](/uploads/f8c424c0-b66d-465a-9178-b3b607da9d9a.jpeg "Monoprice Voxel")

The [**Monoprice Voxel**](#) is a unit that combines the simplicity of an enclosed 3D printer with the added benefit of a fully enclosed build chamber.

The [**Monoprice Voxel**](#) uses Marlin as its firmware and ships with a print monitoring camera on top of the unit, which will allow you to watch your prints in real-time. Like some other printers on this list, the Monoprice Voxel comes with its slicer software to enable you to slice 3D models quickly.

The [**Monoprice Voxel**](#) also has a feature that will assist you in leveling the print bed. This printer is fully enclosed and uses an active cooling fan to keep your prints stuck firmly to the heated bed.

The printer is enclosed in a metal frame, with its standard version coming with an aluminum-built chamber. However, you have the option to upgrade this model to increase its build volume to 150 x 150 x 150 mm.

This 3d printer for beginners is highly affordable and comes ready to use out of the box, making it perfect for beginners and advanced users.

The [**Flashforge Adventurer 3 Lite**](#) is a budget-friendly alternative with the same characteristics as the more recent version. It's got an internal HD camera and a filament sensor, and it's available for a few dollars less than the [**Voxel**](#).

## **Artillery Sidewinder X1**

![Artillery Sidewinder X1](/uploads/df0c54d0-c44f-45d0-9866-93077db26617.jpeg "Artillery Sidewinder X1")

The [**Artillery Sidewinder X1 is a 3D printer**](#) for beginners, a relatively new player on the market. Still, it has already gained a reputation for having a slick design and desirable features such as an AC-powered quick-heating print bed, a sturdy direct drive extruder, and super quiet printing using stepper motor drivers and cooling fans features than less expensive printers.

With a build volume of 300 x 300 x 400mm, the X1 is reasonably sized for a printer in its class.

The OOB experience is fantastic, and it entirely forgives novices with little printing expertise. It's a wonderful place to start for anybody interested in using a large print volume.

If you're looking at getting an affordable yet high-quality machine that has all of the amenities and features as more expensive models, then take note: Artillery's newest product called "Artillery Hornet" could be just what we've been searching for!

It retains many desirable qualities found in its predecessor while cutting back on unnecessary extras so they can provide customers with better value - this means no heated build plate or user-programmable interface paneling (though users still have access through software); however, there are some tradeoffs here too such as reduced accuracy when compared side by side with the [**Sidewinder X1**](#).

In a nutshell, if you have the cash to spare and want a machine that is a workhorse then this is the 3D printer for you..

## **Original Prusa i3 MK3S+**

![Original Prusa i3 MK3S+](/uploads/659d0545-51e9-49f2-8b43-a85cec069460.jpeg "Original Prusa i3 MK3S+")

The original [**Prusa i3 MK3s+**](#) is a 3D printer for beginners that can hold its own against all the printers on this list. It offers exceptional print quality and easy operation, making it an excellent choice for home 3D printing enthusiasts alike!

This high-end model represents quite literally another leap in price from our previous recommendations, which would make someone who was just getting started with DIY projects think twice before investing so much money into what could turn out to be only mediocre results - even though we know firsthand how great these machines typically perform once fully assembled.

The new MK3S+ has been out for a few months now, and it's clear from the feedback that this printer will be an excellent addition in any home or professional setting. The automatic bed leveling feature means you can focus on what matters most: printing! With its slicing software—which even allows users without technical know-how easy accesses information about their models-and crash detection tools if something goes wrong during operation (this is a nice feature that makes working with this model just that much more enjoyable), it's clear that the MK3S+ was designed with its users and their needs in mind.

If you are entirely new to 3D printing, we recommend getting the kit version. The assembled machine costs over $250 more, and yours will be much easier since it's your creation!

## **Flashforge Creator Pro 2**

![Flashforge Creator Pro 2](/uploads/bdac4d7c-3a69-4a08-b44a-fe240f8db654.jpeg "Flashforge Creator Pro 2")

If you're looking for a high-end 3D printer for beginners, the [**Flashforge Creator Pro 2**](https://www.amazon.com/FlashForge-Independent-Structure-Productivity-Possibilities/dp/B095FSYDKM?crid=2O9QKJ3IRK85V&keywords=flashforge+creator+pro+2+3d+printer&qid=1642720771&sprefix=Flash+forge+crea%2Caps%2C171&sr=8-4&linkCode=ll1&tag=3dprintersking-20&linkId=b4260460b96aff7d247b73227733cb75&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) is your best bet. You can get everything from an enclosed build volume and IDEX – which are two very desirable features in this industry! - all at just $800 bucks.

It might not sound super reasonable, but when there are so many other expensive printers out on the market today? This one offer something different: Luxurious printing materials alongside advanced technology make up its design that will astound any builder or creator alike.

With Independent Dual Extrusion, you can print two other materials simultaneously with no hassle. The hardware operates independently along X-axis and uses different filaments simultaneously, making it easier than ever before to create complex designs for multi-color high quality prints or water-soluble supports! You may have experienced some difficulties when using single head systems in the past. Still, IDEX bypasses these problems altogether because they are both printed from their nozzle. Milky Sp ($ prevalent) has been designed specially so that there's never any need to purge previous material off of an empty nest - saving time as well as reducing waste significantly.

The automatic bed leveling probe means you can focus on what matters most: printing! It's a real nice feature that makes working with this model just that much more enjoyable.

In a nutshell, if you have the cash to spare and want a printer that allows for simple testing yet won't hold you back when you outgrow a cheaper model, this is the printer for you.

With the enclosure, you can now print different materials like ABS with a build volume of your choice. And because it's enclosed and heated inside, there are no problems when trying to use similar types in relation; they'll become more durable as well!

The only thing left for the experiment would be finding out what kind works best with this particular machine - since each has its properties, which may affect how successful results will turn out depending on who made them or whether modification took place before installation.

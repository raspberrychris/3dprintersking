A few years ago the concept of having a machine in your own house that can transform digital files into actual tangible objects seemed very far-fetched and like something from a Star Trek movie! If you were looking to collect models or figurines 10-20 years ago, the only way to do it would have been to go into your local city and find a shop that sold that particular item, typically a "model shop".

Now, let's fast forward to today, and with 3D printer technology, you can simply download a file that has been made by someone else and print the model yourself at home. If we take another scenario you may have an appliance that is at home and you find out that the company who made the appliance for whatever reason doesn't support that particular appliance anymore and getting the spare parts replacement is a next to impossible task. Having a 3D printer allows you to print those spare parts yourself - this is a truly revolutionary technology and the ability to make your products from a wide range of materials is infinitely fascinating.

3D Printers are offering a new way to make things and are quickly revolutionizing all kinds of different industries from education, to art, medicine, automotive, and much more.

## What are the advantages of owning a 3D Printer?

Below we will run through some of the advantages as we see them of owning a 3D printer.

### It's enjoyable!

Owning a 3D printer is very enjoyable and the very act of watching your 3D printer whirr away creating your latest project is quite simply a magical experience.

### It lets you be creative

With a 3D printer, you can make whatever you like, whenever you like. Just load up your file and print away!

### It's quick!

Creating a new part for an existing project or even prototyping a whole new idea takes a lot less time than with traditional methods of production. It's also very easy to experiment.

### You can save time and money

The affordability and convenience of 3D printing are revolutionizing the way we think about spare parts. 3D printers make it possible to print just what you need when itâ€™s most convenient for your workflow. With the right skills and equipment, you can have a custom piece printed in less than an hour.

If you have a 3D Printer you can save money by fixing things yourself. For example, if an appliance breaks down and needs to be fixed at home or in the car instead of buying a new one - 3D printing a new spare part could end up being cheaper than replacing the entire appliance.

### You can make money 3D printing

This is what most people reading this post will be interested in. The answer is yes you can make money from 3D Printing! You can make anything that you can think of with 3D Printing. Examples of things that people have made that can be sold are jewelry, key fobs, vases and anything that is decorative or arty in general. Check out Etsy for more inspiration of what you can do with a 3D Printer and check out the prices that they are selling some of these items for. The good thing about having your own 3D Printing business is that you don't have to spend time making the items yourself, you can just set the 3D printer to make the items when they are purchased, almost like drop shipping but without the hassle of ordering products direct from China or anywhere else.

## What are the disadvantages of owning a 3D Printer?

Ok, so we have taken a considerable look at some of the main advantages of owning a 3D printer, in this section we will take some time to look at some of the disadvantages of 3D Printers.

### The size of 3D Printers - They are big!

If you want to build big models (and let's face it, we all generally do), then you will need a big 3D printer with a big build area. A typical 3D printer is both heavy and takes up a lot of desk space, so if you are in a smaller-sized city apartment, then 3D Printing might not be that appealing to you on the grounds of the amount of space it will take up within your living space.

### Noise issues

Typically 3D printers emit sounds of around 45-60db of noise. At the higher end of the spectrum, this can be (quite frankly) annoying, but 3D printer manufacturers are aware of the noise issue and have looked into ways of dampening the sound as much as possible. When you are looking to buy a 3D Printer, always check the decibel of it before you make your decision if it will be in an area where it could potentially annoy either yourself or other family members.

### It can be dangerous for your kids or pets

It should go without saying that any type of machine that is left unattended can be a potential dangerous spot for kids, pets, and other people in the presence of a 3D printer. If you have children or pets, always ensure that the 3D printer is not going to be in an area where they could potentially hurt themselves on it, and if you are at all worried about that you should always watch your 3D printer while it is in action. Fire-related accidents have sometimes occurred with incorrectly assembled 3D Printers, so again it is very important to ensure that you are very careful when you put your 3D printer together.

### You will need to learn or have knowledge about 3D Printing to make the most of it

This is where you need to be passionate about 3D Printing to make the most of it. There is a lot to learn and we will be the first to admit that we still have to learn a lot about 3D printing and making the most of your purchase is not always the most straightforward task. There is a long learning curve and you will need a lot of time to master your 3D printer completely. Another factor that many people don't realize when they get into 3D printing is that not all of the 3D Printers come fully assembled. If you are new to 3D printing then this may shock you like the idea of assembling something that you have just bought may seem a little archaic, but it is necessary to keep prices affordable for more consumers. So in summary you will need a little bit of knowledge, or be able to follow instructions easily and be prepared to learn.

### Do you know CAD? If not you may be limiting your 3D Printing experience

If you do not know what CAD is then you will be limiting your 3D Printer experience to only the models that have been provided from files that other people have made. To make the absolute most of your 3D Printer then you ideally should have some CAD skills and be able to design your own models from scratch. (You can still have a lot of fun without ANY CAD skills at all though)!

### Additional costs

When beginners purchase their first 3D printer they may expect everything to work straight out of the box. This is not always the case unfortunately and either you will need to purchase additional filament spools or other accessories to maintain the 3D printer. Several 3D printers do come with filament spools included, but it can often be on the smaller side, so it is always worth investing in your filament alongside the purchase of your 3D printer. When budgeting for your 3D Printer it is worth included budgeting for accessories that you might need.

### Repairing

Assuming you are keeping your 3D Printer then at some point it will, unfortunately, break down. The purchase of new PTFE tubes, nozzles, and cooling fans means that it can add up if you have an unreliable 3D Printer. This is why it is always good to invest in a quality 3D printer from the outset so you don't have to pay as much in repair costs just to get it to work again.

## Is a 3D Printer worth it for you?

After weighing up the advantages and disadvantages of having a 3D printer, you should be in a better place to understand the risks, benefits, and advantages of owning a 3D Printer.

We love 3D printers here at 3D Printers King, so for us, it is hard to say that they are not worth it as we have had so many personal benefits from owning one ourselves. The disadvantages that we have mentioned are real, however, and can impact your 3D printer journey, but for us, the technology is still magical that you can print something that is a tangible object in your own home and not need to purchase it. It always pays to research before you get into 3D printing and we have a lot of articles on the site that can help you understand the advantages and disadvantages of different 3D Printers.

## **What is 3D Printing?**

### **Introduction**

3D printing is a manufacturing technology where three-dimensional objects are created from a digital file. They range from plastic toys to metal motorcycle parts and everything in between.

[**Chuck Hull**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chuck_Hull) invented the first 3D printer in 1980. Until the early 2000s, companies began developing consumer-friendly versions for everyday use.

## **The Growing Popularity of 3D Printing**

3D printing is growing in popularity for a variety of reasons. First, technology is becoming more accessible and affordable. 3D printers can now be found in home schools and the businesses world.

Second, 3D printing is versatile. [**The range of objects that can be created using 3D printing technology is vast and ever-growing**](/posts/can-a-3d-printer-print-anything/). Some printers can create plastic toys, metal motorcycle parts, human organs, and much more.

Third, 3D printing is fast. Unlike traditional manufacturing methods that require time-consuming processes and specialized tools, 3D printers can create a three-dimensional object in minutes or hours.

Fourth and finally, 3D printing is eco-friendly. 3D printers use less material than traditional manufacturing methods, and many 3D printers can use recycled materials. 3D printing is also more energy-efficient than other manufacturing methods because 3D objects are often hollow and don't require much material as traditional two-dimensional parts.

## **How to Choose the Right 3D Printer for You**

When choosing the right 3D printer for you, consider a few things. One of the most important factors is the build volume of the 3D printer. This is the maximum size of the 3D object that the 3D printer can print.

Another important factor to consider is the minimum layer height of the 3D printer. This is the thickness of each layer of filament that the 3D printer prints. The thinner each layer is, the smoother and more detailed your 3D printed object will be.

The type of filament that the 3D printer uses is also important to consider. Some 3D printers use ABS filament, which is made from synthetic materials and emits harmful fumes when printing. Other 3D printers use PLA filament, which is made from corn starch and natural materials.

![Pla-filament-makerbot](/uploads/28334cb1-b426-41fb-bedb-8e1bfc5cab25.jpeg "Pla-filament-makerbot")

[**Click here to check out the above huge PLA Filament pack from Makerbot on Amazon.com…**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LU1U8Y6?ie=UTF8&linkCode=ll1&tag=3dprintersking-20&linkId=bcbb07bb5770426709440989ce8bbae8&language=en_US&ref_=as_li_ss_tl)

3D printers that use PLA filament aren't harmful to the environment or the people 3D printing them.

In addition to these factors, you should also consider your budget when choosing a 3D printer. 3D printers range in price from a few hundred dollars to several thousand depending on features, 3D printing technology, and size.

3D printers also have different 3-year warranties depending on 3D printer type, 3D printer brand, 3D printer model, etc.

Finally, another key factor is the noise level. Quietness isn't always the most important factor in 3D printing, but 3D printers that are very quiet 3D print jobs are 3D printing neater, and you won't have to worry about complaints from 3D printer noise.

The more you know about 3D printers before purchasing one for your home or office setting, the easier it will be to choose the right 3D printer for you.

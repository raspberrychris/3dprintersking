3d printing on a Glass Bed Explained

In this article we will take a look at 3D printing on a glass bed. It is no surprise that for many this is considered the ultimate 3D printing surface for most printers in use today, as glass provides a durable and smooth finish. The many different types of 3D printer beds on offer mean there's something perfect suited to your needs.

There are many reasons to print on glass, but it's important that you know whether or not your printer can handle the stress of a heavy-duty surface. My favorite thing about this guide is explaining all those differences between types - there truly isn't just one option when choosing how thickly layered something should be.

From a visual perspective straight away the printer's glass bed is a perfect place to showcase all of your beautiful 3D prints. You can purchase one or install it yourself, which takes only minutes. Let's jump in to the reasons why we think Glass beds are actually really good for 3D Printing.

## Glass is one of the flattest surfaces out there

The aluminum surface on your printer is not flat. It may have even been bowing to one side or another since new, and this will only get worse over time as you use it! This should come as no surprise considering how thin the metal used for these plates often. But why does this matter? If you want your print to come out perfectly, then it's important that the 3D printer moves at exactly equal speeds along both its length and width. Otherwise there could be some defects in shape or size. Glass is the best choice for a 3D printing bed as it will always be smooth and retains a flat surface, we have never had any issues with a glass bed.

## Glass is easy to clean

In a minute or less you can easily and painlessly clean a glass bed. Applying another brand new layer of adhesion material can take just seconds with the a good glass bed.

## Glass is Smooth - which makes your prints smooth as well

One of the great things about glass is that the prints that come off it are some of the smoothest out there. There is no roughness or unwanted texture and you don't have to carefully sand down unwanted roughness.

## Price - Glass beds are not as expensive as you think

Affordability. Glass beds are possible one of the best upgrades you can give your 3D Printer. You will find that on Amazon.com and other retailers there are glass beds that you can get at very affordable prices.

## No more Scraping your prints off the bed

One of the most satisfying things of having a glass bed is the ease of removing your completed models from the bed. This means that you won't have to carefully work out a way how to remove your precious model from the 3D printer using all manner of tools, instead, it will just gently pull off. This means there is a huge reduction in the chance of you breaking your creation at this stage, which can't be a bad thing at all.

## What Types of Glass Bed are there?

The glass we use on our windows and in jars is not the same as laboratory equipment. The properties of each type determine what they're used for, but there's something else that makes them all unique.

## So which is the best glass type for a 3D Printer?

The short answer is that **Borosilicate** is the type of glass that you want for your glass bed on your 3D printer. It has a higher Thermal shock resistance than Soda-lime silicate and Phosphates glass types. It also has a high chemical resistance. If you are wondering what Thermal shock resistance is then it is simply a fancy way of saying the ability of the material to cope with dramatic changes in temperature, either when warming up or cooling down.

## Hair spray and 3D printing... What?

**Top Tip:** If you are looking to get good adhesion on your glass bed then you can spray hair spray across the bed. Any brand will do, but we tend to go for the cheaper hair sprays, which you should be able to find in most stores.

## Conclusion

If you are on the fence about getting a glass bed as your next build surface why not give it a try. We think that glass beds definitely have a lot of positive points and it can make your 3D printing life a lot more easier.

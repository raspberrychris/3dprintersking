## **Features of the ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D Printer**

* Large Print Size & Auto Leveling, Small body but Large printing volume of 9.6"(L) x 9.6"(W) x 10.2"(H) / 245 x 245 x 260mm, ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D printer equipped with intelligent leveling system, accurately detect 16-point and automatically adjust the height of nozzle to platform, 1 click to auto leveling, which is friendly use for both veterans and recruits.
* Accurate & Silent Printing, Vyper FDM 3D printer Equipped with new 32-bit motherboard and high-performance Cortex -M3 architecture main control chip, enable the system to run faster and smoother. TMC2209 silent driver makes the motherboard have both silent printing and precise voltage output control, ensuring a more accurate and silent printing.
* PEI Spring Steel Magnetic Platform, Vyper 3D printer adopted a new platform of a special coating combined with spring steel, which features non-deformation at high temperature, scratch-resistant coating and easy model removal by bending or popping. Widely compatible with PLA/ABS/PETG/TPU filaments.
* Fast Printing, Vyper printing head adopts a double fan two-way heat dissipation system, helping to cool down models rapidly. Compared with ordinary 3D printers, the printing quality is the same while the printing speed is faster, which can reach 100mm/s. Patented Z-axis Gap Elimination Module can avoid print layer marks and ensure printing precision.
* More Function, A, Fast Assembly, integrated structure and modular design. B, 4.3 inch large-size touch screen, easy to operate. C, Double-gear extrusion system, is able to reduce the chances of filament tangle and compatible with PLA and flexible filaments. D, Resume print and Material breakage detection. E, Safe power supply.

5/5

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This really is a fantastic mid range 3D Printer that is suitable for both advanced users and beginners in our opinion.  It is not one of the most affordable printers we have reviewed, but it does have a lot of features crammed into one package that is sure to delight anyone who has an interest in 3D Printing.  ANYCUBIC's philosophy to be the best 3D Printer Company out there is ambitious, but it seems likely to happen if they keep this level of quality with their 3D Printers.

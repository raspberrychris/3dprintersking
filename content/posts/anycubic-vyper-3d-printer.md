In this post we will be taking a look at the [**ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D Printer**](#)**.**  This is a 3D printer that has been described by some as the "Creality killer!" With Anycubic 3D Printers they have a strong goal of being "The most popular 3D Printer Brand" and this isn't just talk as you get lifetime technical support, so we are confident that ANYCUBIC really are committed to creating quality 3D Printers here.

In this review we will take a close look at this 3D Printer and decide how exactly it stacks up compared to some of the other 3D Printers we have looked at.  Below we will compare the [**ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D Printer **](#)to other similar 3D printers and understand whether it provides value for money for you!  Without further or do lets get into the review.

## Who is the [**ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D Printer **](#)for?

If you are looking to purchase a 3D printer then you may be looking at the Anycubic brand.  Customers who have bought this product on Amazon.com say the top features of this product are the touch screen, the print quality, the adhesion, the tech support and say that it is also suitable for beginners.  This 3D printer from the outset feels like a good allrounder.  

The Anycubic Vyper 3D Printer is an FDM 3D Printer (Fused Deposition Modeling) It supports a number of filaments, from PLA to TPU, ABS, PETG and also wood.  It has a print resolution of ±0.1mm and has a printing speed of ＜180mm/s (recommended 80-100mm/s)

## **Features of the ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D Printer**

* Large Print Size & Auto Leveling, Small body but Large printing volume of 9.6"(L) x 9.6"(W) x 10.2"(H) / 245 x 245 x 260mm, ANYCUBIC Vyper 3D printer equipped with intelligent leveling system, accurately detect 16-point and automatically adjust the height of nozzle to platform, 1 click to auto leveling, which is friendly use for both veterans and recruits.
* Accurate & Silent Printing, Vyper FDM 3D printer Equipped with new 32-bit motherboard and high-performance Cortex -M3 architecture main control chip, enable the system to run faster and smoother. TMC2209 silent driver makes the motherboard have both silent printing and precise voltage output control, ensuring a more accurate and silent printing.
* PEI Spring Steel Magnetic Platform, Vyper 3D printer adopted a new platform of a special coating combined with spring steel, which features non-deformation at high temperature, scratch-resistant coating and easy model removal by bending or popping. Widely compatible with PLA/ABS/PETG/TPU filaments.
* Fast Printing, Vyper printing head adopts a double fan two-way heat dissipation system, helping to cool down models rapidly. Compared with ordinary 3D printers, the printing quality is the same while the printing speed is faster, which can reach 100mm/s. Patented Z-axis Gap Elimination Module can avoid print layer marks and ensure printing precision.
* More Function, A, Fast Assembly, integrated structure and modular design. B, 4.3 inch large-size touch screen, easy to operate. C, Double-gear extrusion system, is able to reduce the chances of filament tangle and compatible with PLA and flexible filaments. D, Resume print and Material breakage detection. E, Safe power supply.

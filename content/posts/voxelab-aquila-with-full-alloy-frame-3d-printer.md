## Our Verdict

**4/5**

If you are looking for an affordable entry 3D printer then this is really a good alternative to 3D printers such as the [**Ender 3 V2**](/posts/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer/) (which is it is basically a clone) or the [**FlashForge Adventurer**](#)**.**  In essence what you are getting here is a [**FlashForge 3D Printer**](#), but just with a different badge on it, so you can be sure that you are getting a quality product straight away.  In particular the build volume for this 3D printer is hugely impressive for a printer that is this affordable.  We haven’t seen another 3D printer at the time of writing that has a bigger build area at this price point.

**4/5**

⭐⭐⭐⭐

This 3D printer is one of the most portable 3D Printers that we have reviewed on [**3D Printers King**](https://3dprintersking.com).  If you are looking for a very portable 3D printer and the build size is not an issue for you then you will be interested in this 3D printer.  Also if you are living in a smaller sized apartment and you don't want you 3D printer to encroach on your living space then this 3D printer will be perfect for you.  If you are a beginner to 3D printing then you are also going to love this 3D printer for its ease of use, clever design and the fact that everything is included right out of the box and setup is an absolute breeze taking around 15 minutes.  So is this the perfect entry level 3D Printer?  It almost is in our opinion, the one thing that we would like to see from the future is more support for 3rd party filament and not to be 100% locked into XYZ Printing's filament.  We think this factor is likely to put off some more advanced users, but if this is not of a concern to you then you will love this 3D Printer!

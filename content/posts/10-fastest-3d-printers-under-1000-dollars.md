## **Why do people use 3D printers in their everyday lives?**

There are many reasons why people use 3D printers in their everyday lives. Some of the reasons include:-

â€¢ cost-effective: 3D printers are cost-effective because they can print a wide variety of items using different materials. This saves users money on purchasing multiple items.

â€¢ innovative: 3D printers are innovative because they allow users to create customized items according to their needs and specifications.

â€¢ fast: 3D printers are fast because they can print an item in a short amount of time.

â€¢ versatile: 3D printers are versatile because they can be used for a variety of purposes, such as printing prototypes, models, and small parts.

â€¢ customized: 3D printers are customizable because they can print items in different shapes, colors, and sizes.

## **5 Applications of 3D Printing Technology**

As 3D printing technology continues to evolve, its applications continue to expand. Here are five of the most important applications of 3D printing:

### **Printing Prototypes**

3D printing is a great way to quickly create prototypes of new products. This allows businesses to test out new ideas and designs before investing in expensive manufacturing processes.

### **Printing Models**

3D printing is also being used to create models for architects, engineers, and other designers. This allows them to see their designs in three dimensions and make necessary adjustments before moving on to the next step.

### **Printing Small Parts**

3D printers can be used to print small parts for products that need to be assembled. This eliminates the need for manufacturers to waste time and money on shipping small parts all over the world.

### **Printed Electronics**

3D printers can be used to print electronic devices, including circuit boards. This allows manufacturers to save time and create complex electronics that would have been difficult or impossible with standard manufacturing techniques.

For example, this technique has made it possible for NASA to send equipment into space requiring printed parts that might not have survived the trip otherwise.

### **Printing Medical Devices**

3D printing is being used in medicine to print dental implants, custom prosthetics, surgical guides, and other necessary medical items quickly and inexpensively. It is also being used in education as a teaching tool for students who are studying anatomy and physiology.

Students can make physical copies of organs or bones and learn how they work by holding them in their hands.

## **Which is the Right 3D Printer for You? - What to Consider**

### **Before You Buy**

When looking to buy a 3D printer, there are many factors to consider. Here are seven aspects you should take into account before making your purchase: speed, specifications, affordability, durability, print quality, filament type, and the size of the object you want to print.

### **Speed - How quickly can it print?**

How speedily a 3D printer prints will depend on how high the resolution is (determining speed) as well as other factors such as how fast it can move and extrude.

Some printers boast speeds up to 300mm per second, but what does this mean in reality? The speed alone isn't something that should make or break your purchase, and ideally, you'd like a speed that matches your needs for speed and quality, i.e., do you need speed or quality?

### **Specifications - Compatibility with other devices & materials**

The printer's specifications are extremely important when it comes to compatibility -the machine needs to be compatible with your software so that you can print models. Still, thereare also different types of filament that may have varying specifications for extrusion speed, temperature, etc., so you need to know if they are compatible or not!

Finally, you'll want a printer that is powerful enough to handle the size of objects that you plan on printing - smaller printers will only support small prints whereas larger printers can handle larger objects just fine.

### **Affordability**

When it comes to affordability, don't forget about ongoing costs! Not only will the printer cost a lot in the first place, but you'll need to purchase filament, which can be expensive. It's important to consider what price range you are looking at when purchasing a 3D printer -- some may fall within your set budget but not be out of reach for everyone.

### **Durability**

It might not be something you consider when buying a new machine, but it should make an impact on whether or not you buy one. You want the machine sturdy and durable enough that it lasts over time without breaking down, so ask yourself how frequently do I plan on using this?

Is it their warranty? Is there customer service available (in case something does go wrong)? Do they offer spare parts?

### **Print Quality - Accuracy & Resolution**

When it comes to accuracy and resolution, look at the printing speed as a factor. For example, if it prints fast but is only accurate up to a certain speed, then speed might not be that important after all. To avoid this, you'll want a printer that can perform accurately from slower speeds too.

It's also important to consider the size of the object you plan on printing -- if you want to print larger objects, then your machine needs to have a large enough build volume for this.

### **Filament Type - Plastics & Metals**

Some 3D printers use special filaments such as PLA or ABS plastic or metal filaments, so before purchasing one, make sure their filament type is compatible with what you need.

### **The Size of Object You Want to Print**

You'll need to know the size of the object you want to print on your new machine before making a purchase. When it comes to smaller 3D printers, their build volume is generally less than larger printers.

If speed and accuracy are important, then you should definitely consider how large or small your prints will be (and look for a printer that matches these specifications).

Here are seven aspects you should take into account before buying: speed, specifications, affordability, durability, print quality, filament type, and the size of the object you want to print.

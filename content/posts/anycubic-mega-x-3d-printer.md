## Who is the ANYCUBIC MEGA X 3D Printer for?

With so many features and a slightly less affordable price point than some of the other 3D printers that we have reviewed you could be mistaken for thinking that this wasn't a 3D printer that would be suitable for beginners, but we completely disagree with that statement as we think it is actually a really good beginners 3D printer.

In terms of the top features of this 3D printer the print quality comes out top for us and the ease of use.  The tech support with [**ANYCUBIC**](/brands/anycubic) printers is generally very good and to date we have never had any problems with their service.

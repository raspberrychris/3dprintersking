In this post we will be taking a look at the [**VOXELAB Aries 3D Printer**](#).  This 3D Printer has a print speed of ≤180mm/s and around 20-60mm/s normally which doesn’t make it one of the fastest 3D printers that we have reviewed, but it is competitive.  It comes with a bit of PLA filament so you have everything you need to get started.  In terms of assembly it comes largely assembled already so it is suitable for beginners and is easy to put together.

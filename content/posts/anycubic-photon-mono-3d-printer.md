## Verdict

### 4/5

This is a well packaged 3D printer that is straight forward to assemble.  It takes less than 20 minutes to get up and started which is great for beginners.  The instructions are also fantastic and come with a comprehensive build plate levelling guide.  The included software has 16x Anti-aliasing for smooth surfaces.

Another thing that we love about this 3D printer is that it comes with all the necessary accessories (again great for beginners).  That means that you get included a metal scraper, gloves, mask, paper filters and all necessary tools.  

The UV cover stop odors leaking but also the transparent nature of it means you can see your build’s progress easily.  

The last thing that we love about the  Photon Mono 3D Printer is the fact that you can pause and resume printing without having to wait until the end of the build.  This means you will not waste unnecessary resin.  

Taking all of this into account we think that this 3D printer deserves a solid 4/5.  If you are a beginner then you will definitely love many of the features about this 3D printer.

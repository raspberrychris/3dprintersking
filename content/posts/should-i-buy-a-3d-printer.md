**3D printers can be a lot of fun and very useful machines to have at home. In this article we're going to discuss the pros and cons of owning a 3D printer and what you actually get out of owning a 3D printer. It's important to consider these things before you make the decision to buy a 3D printer.  Without further ado, lets dive in and see what the pros and cons are of owning a 3D Printer!**

## Pros and Cons of Owning a 3D Printer

**So what exactly are the pros and cons of owning a 3D Printer?**

Owning a 3D printer has some benefits to it. There are a lot of benefits to owning a 3D printer, such as the ability to print your own things quickly and easily, the ability to create complex structures, and the ability to save a lot of time by creating things yourself.

If you were wondering though, there are also some cons to owning a 3D printer. One of the main cons is that it can be difficult to learn how to use a 3D printer if you are a beginner. It can take some time to figure out how to print using the correct settings and with the right materials. Additionally, 3D printers can be expensive, so it may be tough to justify the cost for some people.  Don’t let these things put you off though.  There are plenty of resources on the internet that can help you how use your 3D Printer and also many manufacturers offer free technical support and some manufacturers of 3D Printers are even offering lifetime support now.

If you are interested in owning a 3D printer, there are a few ways to get started. You can search for a 3D printer that is available for sale or you can look into online resources that will help you learn more about how to use a 3D printer.  This site also includes a wide variety of resources that will help you learn more about how to use a 3D printer.

### Pros of Owning a 3D Printer

Owning a 3D printer has many benefits to it. 3D printers are the hottest trend that is taking the world by storm! Regardless of whether you’re a hardcore technophile, a beginner or someone just looking for a hobby, 3D printers have something for everyone. There is no doubt that 3D printers are incredible pieces of technology. You will truly be astonished the very first time you see one in use. But before you can start printing out an endless stream of toys and models, there are a few things to consider before you invest in one. We will try to highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of owning a 3D printer in this blog post, so you’ll be better informed before you take the plunge on your own printer!

There is no doubt that owning a 3D printer will reduce your dependence on physical stores, this is especially true when it comes to purchasing small, quick to print objects. For example, what do you do when you need a new cable tie? Going to the store to buy one can be a hassle, especially if you only need one. If you own a 3D printer, you can print one yourself! Cable ties are small and inexpensive to buy, but printing your own will save you a lot of trouble. You don't even have to go to the store to buy the material you need for the cable tie. All you need is a 3D model of one, and you can print that cable tie as many times as you want. However, before you can start printing out endless streams of toys and models, there are a few things to consider before you invest in one. We will try to highlight some of the advantages and disadvantages of owning a 3D printer in this blog post, so you'll be better informed before you take the plunge on your own printer!

**Advantages:**  
\- 3D printers are small and (generally) easy to use.  
\- They are perfect for printers that are not very space-restricted.  
\- They can print quickly and without any fuss.  
\- You can print with a wide variety of materials (Check before you buy what the 3D Printer can print on to).

## Cons of Owning a 3D Printer

Cost consideration should be an important factor when deciding on whether to buy one. While owning a 3D printer is definitely a great option for those who are not very space-restricted, there are some costs that must be considered. Some of the more important costs that must be taken into account when purchasing a 3D printer include the price of the material and the cost of purchasing the 3D model.  There are a few things to consider before you invest in one. We will try to highlight some of the disadvantages of owning a 3D printer in this blog post, so you'll be better informed before you take the plunge on your own printer!

**Cons of Owning a 3D Printer: - Printing can be an expensive hobby**

\- 3D printers are not very reliable and break down frequently.  
\- They are not very portable.  
\- They can be expensive and can be frustrating to work with.

### Cost Considerations of Owning a 3D Printer

Cost consideration should be an important factor when deciding on whether to buy one. 3D printers are wonderful little gadgets that could make you life much easier, especially at the office and in your own home. With the market exploding and prices getting lower, it doesn’t hurt to consider investing in one for your business or for your own use, either. 3D printing has a few widely-known uses, including building models (e.g. D&G) and prototypes, helping educators and students learn and much more. It’s still considered a young technology, which means there are many ways to use it that we haven’t even dreamed of yet! So what could you do with one? Could you use it to improve your life? To learn new skills or create business-related objects? Let’s find out what the pros and cons are of owning a 3D printer.

**What is 3D Printing?**

3D printing is a process whereby, in the most basic terms, objects are created from a digital design on a computer. The “object” is manufactured layer by layer via a printer, which builds on one layer, moving upwards, until the object is created. It’s an additive process, and each layer is essentially a single slice of the 3D image.

**Where Can You Buy a 3D Printer?**

There are a couple of places where you can purchase a 3D printer: the manufacturer’s website, third party retailers and even Amazon.com.

## Considerations of Owning a 3D Printer

If you’re looking to add 3D printing to your toolkit, there are a few things you should keep in mind. One is that it’s still a young technology, so there are many ways to use it that we haven’t even thought of yet! So what could you do with one? Could you use it to improve your life? To learn new skills or create business-related objects?  One thing to keep in mind is that 3D printing is still a young technology - there are still many unrealised opportunities of 3D printing and you might be able to create a new opportunity with your very own 3D printer!

### Conclusion

If you do buy a 3D printer it is, of course, not always smooth sailing. You will have to find the right materials and learn how to use the 3D printer, but as 3D printing is becoming more and more popular and manufacturers develop better products, there will be less barriers to entry with better products being developed in the future. In this article we've looked at the pros and cons of owning a 3D printer and how crucial preparation is before making the decision. Do your homework first and think hard before splashing out on one. For most people who own a 3D printer they don't regret the decision they made to buy one, it's certainly a cool device capable of creating some amazing things!

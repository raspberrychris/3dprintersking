## **Our Verdict**

**4/5**

⭐⭐⭐⭐

[**FlashForge**](/categories/flashforge) have created a smart and light 3D printer with the [**FlashForge Adventurer 3 3D Printer**](#).  There is no bed levelling required with this printer and the nozzle is easily removable.  The 100 micro resolution capability means you are going to get a really high quality print as well.  In terms of the slicer software that comes with it, [**FlashPrint**](https://www.flashforge.com/product-detail/FlashPrint-slicer-for-flashforge-fdm-3d-printers).

In terms of the negatives we did notice that this printer would occasionally clog up in the fillament head.  [**FlashForge**](/categories/flashforge) provide a cleaner to help clean the fillament head, and you can also buy replacements, but this would be our only aspect of this printer that could be improved.

Overall, this [**Flashforge Adventurer 3 3d**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07ZR467YR/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=3dprintersking-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B07ZR467YR&linkId=50e183021ecbd798268278e0f44d4242) printer is extremely fun to print with. It is reliable and its prints are high quality and detailed.

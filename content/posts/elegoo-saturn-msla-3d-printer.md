## **Features of the ELEGOO Saturn MSLA 3D Printer**

### **Faster printing speed**

The Saturn 3D printer comes with an 8.9inch 4K Monochrome LCD with an HD resolution of 3840 x 2400, reducing the layer printing time to 2s-3s, which is 60% faster than [**the Mars Pro**](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B095K3JWP3/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=3dprintersking-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B095K3JWP3&linkId=208abdf7dc74d77870ff49abeaab1b94), yet still delivers outstanding printing results.

### **Larger build volume**

Saturn has a large printing volume of 192_120_200mm/7.55in_4.72in_7.87in, and you can print multiple full-sized models at the same time, which can dramatically improve your productivity.

### **Higher precision & easier printing**

Z-axis utilizes a double linear guide-way structure, which can achieve steadier motion and greatly enhanced moving accuracy. With the Ethernet port on the back, Saturn now supports file transfer through your local area network, which is very handy for fast printing.

### **Quality Prints and Consistent Success**

Matrix light source consists of 54 UV LED lights with uniform light emission, ensuring superior print results and a more accurate printing size. The set screws on the build plate assure long-lasting leveling, no need for frequent calibration, and the sandblasted surface provides a much stronger adherence, especially when printing large 3D models.

### **Warranty & Service**

We provide a 1-year warranty on the whole printer (4K LCD, FEP film, and tool kit excluded). Replacement parts will be shipped from the overseas warehouse to offer you quality and fast customer service.

### **Aluminimum resin tank**

## Official Creality Ender 5 Pro 3D Printer - Who is it for?

This 3D Printer is suitable for a wide range of people, we wouldn't class it strictly as a beginners 3D printer as it has a lot of features that go above and beyond that, but saying that there is nothing to stop a tech savvy beginner picking up this 3D Printer and getting started with 3D printing.  

**Some of the key things we love about this 3D printer are below:**

### Upgraded Silent Motherboard V4.2.2  
Metal Extruder Kit

![](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61pIv3EufsL._SX522_.jpg)

One of the criticisms of many 3D Printers is the noise output. The Ender 5 Pro demonstrates firm properties with the added effect of reducing noise from the printer and also improving printing performance.  The metal extruder frame careful feeds in filaments and is water resistant, meaning better print quality.  The last component to be improved is the imported Capricorn Bowden PTFE Tubing.

###   
Capricorn Premium XS Bowden Tubing

The Capricorn XS Bowden Tubing has a high temperature resistance making feeding into the machine smoother overall and means that you get a fantastic print texture.  From our tests we can say that this really is a key feature for us in our opinion.

###   
Brand Power Supply

The hot bed for this 3D printer is capable of heating up to 110 C in 5 minutes!

###   
Y axis with dual shaft

If you have had a 3D printer that has had issues with shock imbalance after printing for a long time then you will like this feature.  The Y axis with dual shaft makes the output of your 3D Printer more stable.

###   
220X220X300 Printing Size

Need to create more than one model?  Now you can!  This 3D printer really had a big build area, and is one of the biggest that we have reviewed so far.  This means that you can create more ambitious models or even multiple models if you want to.

###   
Removable Building Surface

The removable building surface enables you to remove models really easily.  This is a nice feature that we have seen on some other 3D printers, but it is nice that it has been incorporated into the Official Creality Ender 5 Pro 3D Printer.

## Our Verdict

**5/5**

⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

This is a fantastic printer and one of our favourites here at [**3D Printers King**](https://3dprintersking.com).  If you are looking for a really good quality 3D Printer that gives you high quality prints then you can't go far wrong with this model from [**Comgrow**](/categories/comgrow).  It is packed with features that make it easy to use and also has a huge build area so if you need to you can create multiple models at the same time, you really can with this 3D Printer!   This isn't exactly a beginners 3D printer, but it is definitely a 3D Printer that you can grow into in our opinion.  How does it compare with the competition?  In terms of the build area we would say that at this price point it may be hard to find this quality of printer combined with this build area.  Having the bigger build area does obviously mean that the footprint of the machine is larger, which may not suit everyone, but we think that this will make your 3D Printing more enjoyable in the long run as you will have more space to expand your creations when you get more used to 3D Printing.
